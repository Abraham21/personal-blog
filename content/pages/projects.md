## Zeitplan - Daily Planner

Zeitplan is an all in one productivity tool with reminders, daily scheduling, logs, and a Pomodoro timer for efficiency. I cofounded this project with classmates at CPP and lead development with the MEAN technology stack. We built it as a progressive web app with a mobile first design, which we deployed on AWS.

For my final project in my machine learning elective, I chose to build a machine learning model to predict beauty in order to automate online dating. Using Python and [Keras](https://keras.io/), I trained a machine learning model that ranks facial beauty using the [SCUT-FBP500 dataset](https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release) from the South China University of Technology. Using Python and an [unofficial Tinder API](https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder), my program detected faces from Tinder images and fed them into my convolutional neural network. If the model gave a good score, the bot would "swipe right" or like the person. I ran this bot overnight and it swiped on thousands of people, quickly netting me over 100 likes. I have since decommisioned this bot because I find it immoral, but I learned a ton building it and it proved to be a short term solution to automating online dating.
