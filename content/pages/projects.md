## Zeitplan - Daily Planner

Zeitplan is an all in one productivity tool with reminders, daily scheduling, logs, and a Pomodoro timer for efficiency. I cofounded this project with classmates at CPP and lead development with the MEAN technology stack. We built it as a progressive web app with a mobile first design and we deployed it on AWS.

## Machine Learning Tinder Bot

For my final project in my machine learning elective, I chose to build a machine learning model to predict beauty in order to automate online dating. Using Python and [Keras](https://keras.io/), I trained a machine learning model that ranks facial beauty using the [SCUT-FBP500 dataset](https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release) from the South China University of Technology. Using Python and an [unofficial Tinder API](https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder), my program detected faces from Tinder images and fed them into my convolutional neural network. If the model gave a good score, the bot would "swipe right" or like the person. I ran this bot overnight and it swiped on thousands of people, quickly netting me over 100 likes. I have since decommisioned this bot because I found it immoral, but I learned a ton building it and it proved to be a short term solution to automating online dating.

## Vibe - Mobile Application

Vibe is a cross-platform social media app for students that helps them plan impromptu local activities with their friends. I built this project with a couple friends in my early college days using React Native, Algolia Search, Node.js, and Firebase.

## Hackathon Projects

Throughout college, I participated in multiple hackathons. Aside from the networking benefits, hackathons served as a great way to improve my software development and presentation skills. Building a software product in one weekend can be quite hectic!

## Android Applications

I developed many Android apps while learning how to code during my junior and senior years of high school. I published all of my apps in excitement to share with my friends. These apps remain on the store today and some sport a healthy number of users. My favorites are [A to B - Schedule Your Tasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.abestudying.atob), [Flappy Monkey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.abestudying.fartingmonkey), and the [Texas Hold'em Expected Value Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.abestudying.expectedvaluecalculator).
