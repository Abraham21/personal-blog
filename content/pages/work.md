## The Walt Disney Company (May 2019 - August 2021)

I was a **Software Engineer** working on guest experience technologies for Disney Parks & Resorts. I cultivated a wide range of skillsets by working on multiple projects that impact our cast and guests daily. Most notably, I've gained experience in full-stack development using technologies like **Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, Swift, databases, and much more**. Moreover, I've had the pleasure to work with CPP's computer science club, where I'm a [former President](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ayepremian_during-the-last-school-year-i-had-the-great-activity-6582422811602759680-8Yua), on Disney recruiting events.

My journey at Disney began as a summer intern, but I was brought back for part-time work as an Associate Software Engineer while I was finishing my last semester at CPP. Upon my graduation, I became a full-time Software Engineer. My experience at Disney was absolutely incredible!

## USTOSHOP.com (May 2018 - January 2019)

USTOSHOP.com is an e-commerce, logistics, and blockchain startup where I was a **blockchain and full-stack developer**. I began as a full-time summer intern, but became a part-time employee once I resumed school.

My development skills grew immensely during my time with USTOSHOP.com as I was working in a fast-paced environment where I took on many development responsibilties. As one of the core developers in the blockchain team, I was most involved in building our ToopToken cryptocurrency exchange platform (web, mobile, web3) from the ground up. Furthermore, I worked on our single sign on system, payments system, and e-commerce platform. Continuing, I was soley responsible for developing an internal platform for sending bulk SMS and email messages to our customers, which I exposed as an internal API for our developers. Moreover, I was responsible for developing our company's forum with Discourse and integrating into our SSO system. Technologies I became accustomed to during this time included **Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Solidity, and more**.

Fun fact: I was one of the only English speaking employees and I required translation during meetings. Google Translate was a godsend during this time!

## FluffAR (May 2018 - September 2018)

I was a **full-stack developer intern** at FluffAR, which was an augmented reality (AR) application that allowed users to collect cryptocurrency. During my time here, I Implemented AR in **Unity3d**, wrote code on the **NEM blockchain**, and used **AR.js** to implement AR on web. FluffAR later became Captive App, which can be found [here](https://getcaptive.app/).

## Henry Tax (June 2017 - January 2018)

My first internship was working as a **full-stack web developer intern** for [Henry Tax](https://www.henry.tax/), a platform that connects people with accountants to complete their taxes quickly and easily. During my time here, I gained experience in front-end web development, back-end web development, and database management. I utilized the **MeteorJS** framework with **JavaScript**, **MongoDB** as our database, and the **agile Scrum** methodology for project management. After the initial summer internship, I was kept on the team working part-time.
