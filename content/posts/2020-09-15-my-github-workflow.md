I like to follow systems in my work that will prioritize collaboration and project organization. With GitHub, this means making the most of well-defined branches, issues, project boards, and pull requests.

## Branches

When creating a repository, GitHub will set your default branch to the **`main`** branch (previously `master` branch prior to October 1, 2020). My goal is to keep only **deploy-able** and **tested** code in the `main` branch.

Next, I will create a new branch called **`develop`** that will be used for current development.
