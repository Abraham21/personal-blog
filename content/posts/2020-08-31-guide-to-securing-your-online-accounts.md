Estimates report that cyber-crime damages are projected to hit $6 trillion dollars by 2021. During the current pandemic and the worldwide shift towards adopting technology, cyber-security is more important than ever!

## Have you been pwned?

Thanks to security expert Troy Hunt and his website [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), you can easily check if any accounts associated with your email have been exposed in known data breaches.

* Navigate to [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
* Enter your email and see if you have been pwned!

If you have been pwned, your information is out there and attackers can use it to do harm. Nevertheless, your best course of action is to stay calm and continue to follow the rest of this guide - either remediating the damage or preventing it. I highly recommend you sign up for the notification service from HaveIBeenPwned for notifications should any of your accounts be discovered compromised.

## Passwords

If you found any compromised accounts using the first step, immediately change the passwords of those accounts.

Now, you might be wondering what constitutes a good password. The two most important rules to follow are to ***never reuse passwords*** and to always ***use unique, strong passwords***.

The best passwords are long, using a mix of characters, hard to guess, and hard to crack. Some people create their own systems for generating passwords, using the combination of a secret phrase and the website name. The problem with such password algorithms is that they are either too simple to provide the protection you really need or too complex to the point they become a pain to use.

The solution is to ***use a password manager*** that will randomly generate secure passwords and safely store them. Using a password manager allows you to only remember one password. The password manager will encrypt a database of your account passwords, secured by your master password.

From my research, I recommend using [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) due to its free, open source nature. There are many alternatives to look into, such as LastPass, so please feel free to do your own research on various password managers to see if they meet your security, convenience, and pricing requirements. If you are not comfortable with having your passwords stored on the cloud in an encrypted database, you can look into using KeePass - which is a completely offline password manager. However, doing so would sacrifice convenience and could cause you to deviate from using the manager, defeating its purpose. Even if a cloud based password manager is hacked, your data is generally safe because the company does not have your encryption key (your password is required).

Using a password manager, it's incredibly important to choose a new password that is hard to guess or crack. If the master password is compromised, your entire list of passwords can be compromised so please put some time into deciding your master password. Moreover, if you forget your master password, you may be locked out of your password manager causing you to lose all your passwords.

After you've setup the password manager, use the built in password generation to change and store your passwords. Keep your master password, email passwords, and computer passwords out of the password manager. When you are done, you should only have to remember 3-4 unique, strong passwords. If you are a Google user, you can go ahead and remove your passwords from the [Google password manager](https://passwords.google.com/) since you don't want all your passwords to be compromised if someone accesses your email.
